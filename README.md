# E-commerce-Website-Clone

I have developed an eCommerce website using by HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP &amp; JAVASCRIPT. First of all, we have our landing page with banner section, some featured categories images, then some featured products with product price, image and rating. Then, there will be more latest products, and one offer section with exclusive product. After that there will be testimonials and top brands section. At the bottom of website we will make footer with 4 columns.  
After that I have put a drop down menu on top right side corner for mobile screen and I have made this complete website design responsive for any such small screen devices. Then we have other pages like all products page, single product page, shopping cart page, login and registration page, Contact &amp; About us page.
